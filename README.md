# godot-game-template
A template for generating a simple repo with a Godot Project ready to start making a game with.

The Godot Project included in this template contains a simple menu system with a pixel theme, a sub-menu for persistent remappable controls, two Singleton classes: An events Singleton (For an Event Bus design pattern), and a settings Singleton (for storing user config settings to persist sessions), and several other small helper scripts/classes that are all designed to make it easy to jump into the Project and focus on making your game.

This repo is a work in progress, more features are planned and will be added as time goes on. 

If there is a feature that you would like to be included in this template, please feel free to open an issue to request it!

To use this template, simply click the 'Use this template' button in GitHub and chose the repo name for your new game!

Please Note: If you use this template and your game is *Not* intended to be an open source game that anyone should be free clone, reproduce, or distribute with the MIT license, you should either create your repo as 'Private', or change the license in your repo to whichever license you deem acceptable for your project before adding any of your game code/assets to your repo.
